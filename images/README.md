Image assets for the students-rentals site

Files:
- featured-1.svg — placeholder featured property image (3 bed)
- featured-2.svg — placeholder featured property image (studio)
- featured-3.svg — placeholder featured property image (4 bed)
- rental-1.svg — placeholder available rental image (1 bed)
- rental-2.svg — placeholder available rental image (2 bed)
- rental-3.svg — placeholder available rental image (room)

Usage:
- Reference from HTML with <img src="images/featured-1.svg" alt="Featured 1"> or similar.
- For best results add width/height attributes or control size with CSS classes.

Next steps:
- Tell me which pages you'd like me to wire these into (for example `index.html` or `rooms.html`) and I can add the <img> tags with appropriate classes.
